# Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard providing end-to-end visibility into supply chain performance by analyzing revenue, inventory, order fulfillment, defect rates, and supplier metrics to identify inefficiencies and support data-driven decision-making.
## üìñ Project Overview
This repository contains a <b>Power BI‚Äìbased Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard</b> built to provide end-to-end visibility into product performance across three categories: Cosmetics, Haircare, and Skincare. The dashboard helps stakeholders evaluate revenue, inventory, order fulfillment efficiency, defect rates, and supplier performance to uncover operational inefficiencies and drive data-driven supply chain decisions.
## üéØ Business Objective
To evaluate the performance of key product categories across the supply chain by analyzing revenue, inventory, fulfillment efficiency, defect rates, and supplier contributions. The goal is to identify operational inefficiencies, uncover improvement areas, and support data-driven supply chain optimizations.
## üõ†Ô∏è Data Source
- Kaggle: Supply Chain Analysis by Harsh Singh
- Data elements include:
  - SKU‚Äëlevel production and sales volumes
  - Supplier mapping for each product
  - Inventory stock levels
  - Order Fulfillment Rate (OFR)
  - Product defect rates
  - Region and carrier distribution data
## üìä Key KPIs Tracked
| KPI | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Total Revenue** | Sum of sales revenue across categories (‚Çπ5,77,604.82) |
| **Total Quantity Sold** | Total units sold across all SKUs (46,099 units) |
| **Order Fulfillment Rate** | Percentage of customer orders fulfilled completely (OFR) |
| **Average Defect Rate** | Percentage of units returned or marked defective |
| **Available Stock** | Current inventory levels per category |
| **Supplier Contributions** | Sales volume and reliability metrics by supplier |

## üîç Key Insights
- **Skincare** leads with **‚Çπ2,41,628** in revenue and an **85% OFR**, yet there‚Äôs scope for further fulfillment improvement.
- **Haircare** has the **highest defect rate (2.48%)**, requiring immediate attention to product quality initiatives.
- **Cosmetics** exhibits the **lowest OFR (73.08%)**, suggesting potential shipment delays or inventory gaps.
- **Supplier 4 underperforms** across all product lines, contributing the **lowest sales volume and revenue** warranting a performance audit.
- **Stock levels in Haircare** are disproportionately high, signaling overproduction or demand forecasting errors.

## üí° Recommendations
1. Supplier Performance Audit:
   - Conduct a detailed audit of Supplier 4 and consider contract renegotiation or alternative sourcing.
2. Quality Control Initiatives:
   - Implement targeted quality checks in Haircare to reduce defect rates.
3. Inventory Optimization:
   - Adjust reorder points and safety stock levels for Cosmetics to boost fulfillment efficiency.
4. Demand Forecasting Refinement:
   - Rebalance inventory in Haircare based on improved demand forecasting models.
5. Zonal Delivery Analysis:
   - Investigate delivery inefficiencies by region and carrier to reduce lead times and improve OFR.
